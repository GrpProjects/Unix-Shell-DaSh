This project is a group project. The group size is 2. It must be implemented in C. Sharing 
your work with others outside of your group is strictly prohibited. Do not copy code from 
any outside source. Warning: if you plagiarize, you will be caught and reported.
You can develop the project in csgrads1/cs3/csjaws. Compile the code in any of the cs* 
machines. However, do not test/execute in the cs* machines. Use any of the {net01,…, 
net45} machines for program execution. You may create large number of processes due 
to a bug (more on how to handle forkbomb later). You do not want to slow down the cs* 
machines by executing in them. CSTech does not take kindly if you do this. If you are 
caught executing your program in any of the cs* machines, you will be given a ticket. For 
every ticket you receive, we will deduct 5 points from your final score.
Unix Shell
In this project, you will build a simple Unix shell. The shell is the heart of the commandline interface, and thus is central to the Unix/C programming environment. Mastering use 
of the shell is necessary to become proficient in this world; knowing how the shell itself is 
built is the focus of this project.
There are three specific objectives to this assignment:
• To further familiarize yourself with the Unix/Linux programming environment.
• To learn how processes are created, destroyed, and managed.
• To gain exposure to the necessary functionality in shells.
Overview
Your task is to implement a command line interpreter (CLI) or, as it is more commonly 
known, a shell. The shell should operate in this basic way: when you type in a command 
(in response to its prompt), the shell creates a child process that executes the command 
you entered and then prompts for more user input when it has finished.
The shells you implement will be like, but simpler than, the one you run in Unix. If you do 
not know what shell you are running, it's probably bash. One thing you should do on your 
own time is learn more about your shell, by reading the man pages or other online 
materials.
Program Specifications
Basic Shell: dash
Your basic shell, called dash (short for DAllas SHell), is basically an interactive loop: it 
repeatedly prints a prompt dash> (note the space after the greater-than sign), parses the 
input, executes the command specified on that line of input, and waits for the command 
to finish. This is repeated until the user types exit. The name of your final executable 
should be dash.
The shell can be invoked with either no arguments or a single argument; anything else is 
an error. Here is the no-argument way:
prompt> ./dash
dash>
At this point, dash is running, and ready to accept commands. Type away!
The mode above is called interactive mode. It allows the user to type commands directly. 
The shell also supports a batch mode, which instead reads input from a batch file and 
executes commands from therein. Here is how you run the shell with a batch file 
named batch.txt:
prompt> ./dash batch.txt
One difference between batch and interactive modes: in interactive mode, a prompt is 
printed (dash>). In batch mode, no prompt should be printed.
You should structure your shell such that it creates a process for each new command (the 
exception are built-in commands, discussed below). Your basic shell should be able to 
parse a command and run the program corresponding to the command. For example, if 
the user types ls -la /tmp, your shell should run the program /bin/ls with the given 
arguments -la and /tmp (how does the shell know that ls is in /bin? It's something called 
the shell path; more on this below).
Structure
Basic Shell
The shell is very simple (conceptually): it runs in a while loop, repeatedly asking for input 
to tell it what command to execute. It then executes that command. The loop continues 
indefinitely, until the user enters the built-in command exit, at which point it exits. That 
is it!
For reading lines of input, you should use getline(). This allows you to obtain arbitrarily 
long input lines with ease. Generally, the shell will be run in interactive mode, where the 
user types a command (one at a time) and the shell acts on it. However, your shell will 
also support batch mode, in which the shell is given an input file of commands; in this 
case, the shell should not read user input (from stdin) but rather from this file to get the 
commands to execute.
In either mode, if you hit the end-of-file marker (EOF), you should call exit(0) and exit 
gracefully.
To parse the input line into constituent pieces, you might want to use strtok() (or, if doing 
nested tokenization, use strtok_r()). Read the man page (carefully) for more details.
To execute commands, look into fork(), exec(), and wait()/waitpid(). See the man pages 
for these functions and read the relevant book chapter for a brief overview.
You will note that there are a variety of commands in the exec family; for this project, you 
must use execv, not any other call in the exec family. You should not use 
the system() library function call to run a command. Remember that if execv() is 
successful, it will not return; if it does return, there was an error (e.g., the command does 
not exist). The most challenging part is getting the arguments correctly specified.
Paths
In our example above, the user typed ls but the shell knew to execute the 
program /bin/ls. How does your shell know this?
It turns out that the user must specify a path variable to describe the set of directories to 
search for executables; the set of directories that comprise the path are sometimes called 
the search path of the shell. The path variable contains the list of all directories to search, 
in order, when the user types a command.
Important: Note that the shell itself does not implement ls or other commands (except 
built-ins). All it does is find those executables in one of the directories specified 
by path and create a new process to run them.
To check if a particular file exists in a directory and is executable, consider 
the access() system call. For example, when the user types ls, and path is set to include 
both /bin and /usr/bin, try access("/bin/ls", X_OK). If that fails, try "/usr/bin/ls". If that 
fails too, it is an error.
Your initial shell path should contain one directory: `/bin'
Note: Most shells allow you to specify a binary specifically without using a search path, 
using either absolute paths or relative paths. For example, a user could type 
the absolute path /bin/ls and execute the ls binary without a search path being needed. 
A user could also specify a relative path which starts with the current working directory 
and specifies the executable directly, e.g., ./main. In this project, you do not have to worry 
about these features.
Built-in Commands
Whenever your shell accepts a command, it should check whether the command is 
a built-in command or not. If it is, it should not be executed like other programs. Instead, 
your shell will invoke your implementation of the built-in command. For example, to 
implement the exit built-in command, you simply call exit(0); in your dash source code, 
which then will exit the shell.
In this project, you should implement exit, cd, and path as built-in commands.
• exit: When the user types exit, your shell should simply call the exit system call 
with 0 as a parameter. It is an error to pass any arguments to exit.
• cd: cd always takes one argument (0 or >1 args should be signaled as an error). To 
change directories, use the chdir() system call with the argument supplied by the 
user; if chdir fails, that is also an error.
• path: The path command takes zero or more arguments, with each argument 
separated by whitespace from the others. A typical usage would be like this: dash> 
path /bin /usr/bin, which would add /bin and /usr/bin to the search path of the 
shell. If the user sets path to be empty, then the shell should not be able to run any 
programs (except built-in commands). The path command always overwrites the 
old path with the newly specified path.
Redirection
Many times, a shell user prefers to send the output of a program to a file rather than to 
the screen. Usually, a shell provides this nice feature with the > character. Formally this is 
named as redirection of standard output. To make your shell users happy, your shell 
should also include this feature, but with a slight twist (explained below).
For example, if a user types, ls -la /tmp > output, nothing should be printed on the 
screen. Instead, the standard output of the ls program should be rerouted to the 
file output. In addition, the standard error output of the file should be rerouted to the 
file output (the twist is that this is a little different than standard redirection).
If the output file exists before you run your program, you should simply overwrite it (after 
truncating it).
The exact format of redirection is a command (and possibly some arguments) followed 
by the redirection symbol followed by a filename. Multiple redirection operators or 
multiple files to the right of the redirection sign are errors.
Note: don't worry about redirection for built-in commands (e.g., we will not test what 
happens when you type path /bin > file).
Parallel Commands
Your shell will also allow the user to launch parallel commands. This is accomplished with 
the ampersand operator as follows:
dash> cmd1 & cmd2 args1 args2 & cmd3 args1
In this case, instead of running cmd1 and then waiting for it to finish, your shell should 
run cmd1, cmd2, and cmd3 (each with whatever arguments the user has passed to it) in 
parallel, before waiting for any of them to complete.
Then, after starting all such processes, you must make sure to use wait() (or waitpid) to 
wait for them to complete. After all processes are done, return control to the user as usual 
(or, if in batch mode, move on to the next line).
Program Errors
You should print this one and only error message whenever you encounter an error of 
any type:
 char error_message[30] = "An error has occurred\n";
 write(STDERR_FILENO, error_message, strlen(error_message));
The error message should be printed to stderr (standard error), as shown above.
After most errors, your shell simply continue processing after printing the one and only 
error message. However, if the shell is invoked with more than one file, or if the shell is 
passed a bad batch file, it should exit by calling exit(1).
There is a difference between errors that your shell catches and those that the program 
catches. Your shell should catch all the syntax errors specified in this project page. If the 
syntax of the command looks perfect, you simply run the specified program. If there are 
any program-related errors (e.g., invalid arguments to ls when you run it, for example), 
the shell does not have to worry about that (rather, the program will print its own error 
messages and exit).
Miscellaneous Hints
Do not start coding immediately without thinking through the design. Write a simple high 
level design document first. Please bring it to me for a review if you wish. Do not be a 
trial-and-error programmer. Think, design, and code.
Remember to get the basic functionality of your shell working before worrying about all 
the error conditions and end cases. For example, first get a single command running 
(probably first a command with no arguments, such as ls).
Next, add built-in commands. Then, try working on redirection. Finally, think about parallel 
commands. Each of these requires a little more effort on parsing, but each should not be 
too hard to implement.
At some point, you should make sure your code is robust to white space of various kinds, 
including spaces () and tabs (\t). In general, the user should be able to put variable 
amounts of white space before and after commands, arguments, and various operators; 
however, the operators (redirection and parallel commands) do not require whitespace.
Check the return codes of all system calls from the very beginning of your work. This will 
often catch errors in how you are invoking these new system calls. It's also just good 
programming practice.
Beat up your own code! You are the best (and in this case, the only) tester of this code. 
Throw lots of different inputs at it and make sure the shell behaves well. Good code comes 
through testing; you must run many different tests to make sure things work as desired. 
Don't be gentle -- other users certainly won't be.
Finally, keep versions of your code. More advanced programmers will use a source control 
system such as git. (If you are using git, make sure it is private.) Minimally, when you get 
a piece of functionality working, make a copy of your .c file (perhaps a subdirectory with 
a version number, such as v1, v2, etc.). By keeping older, working versions around, you 
can comfortably work on adding new functionality, safe in the knowledge you can always 
go back to an older, working version if need be.
Testing
Make sure you compile your program as follows:
gcc dash.c –o dash -Wall -Werror -O
There should not be any error messages and warning during compilation. 
Sample testcases are in the directory /cs5348-xv6/src/testcases/P1 in csjaws.utdallas.edu. 
Look at README file first. Additional testcases may be provided later. You should also 
write your own test cases and test thoroughly. Writing good testcases is an important skill 
you need to do well in your career.
Your program may end up creating too many processes than intended due to a bug (fork 
bomb). To prevent yourself from being locked out of the system limit the number of 
processes you can create by adding this line to .bashrc file in your home directory.
ulimit –u 90
In case you reach the limit of 100, then login through a different terminal and kill dash
and all the processes created by dash. Use commands “ps –u” and kill pid.
Hand-in Instructions
Name your program as dash.c. Copy your source code to the directory /cs5348-
xv6/xxxyyyyyy/P1 in csjaws, where xxxyyyyyy is your netid. (You will know more about 
csjaws in Exercise 1.)
If you have worked with a partner, only one of you need to submit the files. But both of 
you should create a text file named PARTNER in /cs5348-xv6/xxxyyyyy/P1 and save your 
partner’s name and netid in the file.
Grading
Source code should be structured well with adequate comments clearly showing the 
different parts and functionalities implemented. 10% of the total points is allotted for style 
and comments, and the remaining 90% is for correctness.
The TA will compile the code and test it. If your code does not compile, you will get 0 points.
If you use any other system call other than execv() to execute a command, we will deduct 
50 points from your final score.
You will also be called by the TA to demonstrate your code. If you are not able to explain 
the working of your code, you will not be given any points. 
If you have not contributed to this project, you will get 0 points
